# Teacher-agenda-ember

This is a web app to manage a teacher's agenda.
The key points to achieve with the app are:
1. Have track of your alumns progress viewing what did they do on the last class and save what you teach them when the class is finished.
2. Manage your work load. On index you can see what's your day job, and you can see how does your week look on the timetable.

The web app is built with ember-cli and uses sass as css preprocessor. Following folder standars on ember, when creating a new component with `ember generate component <component-name>` create a scss file inside /scss/components/ with the component name as ember-cli does with js files.
